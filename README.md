Objective: 
Understand the importance of knowledge representation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and explore how it 
enables AI systems to reason, learn, and make decisions.

Objective: To apply multiple regression techniques learned in the course to predict house prices based on 
various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and age of the property. This problem 
simulates a real-world scenario where you need to create a predictive model that can assist real estate 
agents in estimating house prices more accurately. 

Problem Statement: You are a data scientist working for a real estate company. Your task is to develop a 
predictive model that can estimate the prices of houses in a particular city. The dataset provided includes 
multiple features, such as the size of the house (in square feet), the number of bedrooms, the age of the 
house, the proximity to downtown (in miles), and the house price. Your goal is to build a multiple 
regression model that can accurately predict house prices based on these features. 
Dataset Overview: The dataset consists of the following columns: 
• Size (sq. ft.): Size of the house in square feet. 

• Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house. <br/>
• Age: Age of the house in years. <br/>
• Proximity to Downtown (miles): Distance of the house from the downtown area. <br/>
• Price: Actual price of the house (in thousands of dollars). <br/>

Objective:
To apply the concepts of linear regression learned in lectures by implementing a simple linear regression
model from scratch in Python.

Task Overview:
You are provided with a dataset containing information about house prices in a particular city. The
dataset includes features such as the size of the house (in square feet), the number of bedrooms, and
the age of the house. Your task is to predict the price of a house based on these features using a linear
regression model.
