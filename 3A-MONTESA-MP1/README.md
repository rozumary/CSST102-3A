# SECURITY AND SURVEILLANCE IN ML

**Role of ML in Security and Surveillance**

Machine learning is significantly enhancing security and surveillance by improving video analytics, facial recognition, asset monitoring, and predictive analytics, resulting in greater operational efficiency and security.

**Major Challenges**

The security and surveillance sector struggles with detecting intrusions, managing video footage, and predicting threats. Machine learning improves security by identifying unusual patterns that indicate potential breaches, enhancing facial recognition for accurate identification, and predicting threats by analyzing historical data. These advancements lead to more effective threat detection, better video analysis, and proactive security measures.

**EXAMPLES:**

**Video Forensics**

ML-based deep learning can also help in solving crimes if captured on CCTV cameras. Machine learning techniques can be used for color conversion, regeneration, and comparison between two video backgrounds, which will help forensic teams to identify vehicles or objects during the post-incident investigation. AI-based machine learning algorithms can help in other forensic activities such as: 

• Vehicle model detection <br/>
• 3D face reconstruction <br/>
• Video enhancement by Image Super-resolution <br/>
• Video De-hazing and noise reduction <br/>
• License Plate De-hazing <br/>
• Predictive Image searching <br/>

**Face Detection**

Face Detection, Recognition and Alert Accurate face detection and recognition are very critical to law enforcement agencies. It helps in identifying people of interest and is also helpful in post-incident investigations. Broadly, some of the benefits of Facial Recognition application are: 

• Automatic attendance <br/>
• Automatic recognition of authorized individuals or re-identification of unknown people <br/>
• Automatic alert for blacklisted/barred people or no-go zone breach <br/>
• Customizable MIS reports (alerts / movements / area-access / area-usage). <br/>

**Object Tracking**

During post-incident analysis, object tracking facilitates tracking a vehicle in case of a hit-and-run or to track a person who may have left a suspicious package at the incident site. Using computer vision algorithms, once the object in a frame is detected and segmented, it can then be matched against a set of defined categories: a car, bike, truck, man/woman with a cap, jacket, or backpack, etc. 

The VCA software can be trained to identify these categories by using DNN models. Once the object of interest is detected and matched, the object segmentation defines the pixels used by the object and the movement of those pixels across the video frames can be tracked from multiple CCTV Cameras, thereby giving the entry/exit route of the object. 

**Traffic and Road Safety**


AI technology has enabled VCA applications to detect traffic violations accurately and automatically. The availability of a large set of video data and computational resources have enabled the respective DNN models to be trained effectively. 

Here are some of the VCA uses cases for Traffic & Road Safety: 

• No-Helmet and Triple riding detection <br/>
• Wrong-way Driving or Illegal turn detection <br/>
• No-Parking violation detection <br/>
• License Plate Detection <br/>
• Stop-Line Crossing detection <br/>
• No-Seatbelt or Mobile Usage detection <br/>
• Over-Speeding Detection <br/>
